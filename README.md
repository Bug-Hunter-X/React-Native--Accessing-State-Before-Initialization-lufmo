# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been properly initialized. This often leads to unexpected behavior or runtime errors, particularly when using functional components and hooks.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a state variable (`count`) is accessed within a conditional statement (`if (someCondition)`). If `someCondition` is false, the variable might not yet be initialized, causing an error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.  It addresses the issue by ensuring that the state variable is accessed only after the component has fully mounted.  We also use optional chaining to handle potential issues before the state is initialized.
